The idea is that you run 'uploader.sh' every day, and it will:
- Pull a bunch of data from various sources (weather, news, etc.)
- Prompt an OpenAI bot to generate a *topic* for a 'blog post' about that day, based on that data.
- Write the blog post as a html file, and upload it to a github repo.

I'm forever tinkering though, so all this could radically change at any moment.

*Oh, and...*
In the code there are some references to another project that don't make any sense in this context. This is because I'm using the same codebase for both projects- I eventually plan on merging them together- and want to keep things consistent.
