# Daily-Journaler

[See the result of this project in-action.](https://barclay-mcclay.github.io/quotidian/)

To reduce it down to a few steps:
- You run 'uploader.sh' every day and it...
- Pulls a bunch of data from various internet sources (weather, news headlines, etc.)
- Prompts a ChatGPT model to generate a 'blog post' about that day, based on the data it has pulled.
- Writes the blog post as a html file, and uploads it to a github repo.

There's a few more steps in there, but that's the gist of it.

Note that I'm using some of the same code that I have already written for several different projects. I eventually plan on merging these projects together- and want to keep things consistent. So some of the code might not make sense in the context of *just* the Daily-Journaler. Sorry about that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
